Batching:
    https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/requests.html#batching

    A batch of queries can be sent by simply sending a JSON-encoded array of queries, e.g.

    [{ query: '{ testString }' }, { query: 'query q2{ test(who: "you" ) }' }];

    If a batch of queries is sent, the response will be an array of GraphQL responses.



Manifest PWA:

    Works for every user irrespective of the browsers.
    Responsive, I guess need no further explanation on that.
    Has to be served only via HTTPS (except for local host), thereby making it secure
    It gives an app like experience without the need of approvals and uploads to various app stores. You add the app from url directly.
    Easily installable by just adding it to your homes screen, and then using it as any other app.
    Offline first experience to allow users to use the app on no or minimal connectivity.
